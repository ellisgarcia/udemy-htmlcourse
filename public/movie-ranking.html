    <h1>The Top 3 Best Movies According to Ellis</h1>
        <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>
    Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, the film is set in 90s Los Angeles. We see the paths of a handful of characters cross and their stories unfold in back-and-forth jumps between different time points of the story. Simply visually stunning and has one of the best soundtracks to ever grace a movie.
</p>
<h3>Fallen Angels</h3>
<p>
    Wong Kar Wai takes you to 90s Hong Kong. A Hong Kong where the night is as alive as the day. We follow the lives of three individuals who are going through the motions and soon find themselves crossing each other's paths. Truly a work of art, one that is painted with blood and neon.
</p>
<h3>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</h3>
<p>
    Going back to the late 60s in Quentin Tarantino's most recent work. Set in late 60s Los Angeles, the final chapter of the golden age of Hollywood. The film focuses on the lives of two heroes as they live through inevitable changes in business and in life. As a Tarantino product, the soundtrack is gold and the visuals are simply amazing.
